### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding more fields for Add/Edit

### Filter

### Sort
The `sort` command, facilitated by `SortCommand` and `SortCommandParser`, allows users to sort and display their client 
list by various fields (name, phone, email, address, salary, date of birth, marital status, occupation, dependents, insurance package) 
in ascending or descending order. 
Special handling ensures that "Unspecified" values are always placed at the bottom of the sorted list regardless of sort direction.

**Aspect: How sort executes:**

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the system when executing a `sort name ascending` command:

<img src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

**Design Considerations:**

**Aspect: How unspecified values are handled:**

* **Current choice:** Always place "Unspecified" values at the bottom regardless of sort direction.
    * **Pros:** Consistent user experience; important data (specified values) always appears first.
    * **Cons:** May not follow strict alphabetical/numerical order in some cases.

* **Alternative:** Treat "Unspecified" as a regular string/value in sorting.
    * **Pros:** Maintains strict sorting order.
    * **Cons:** "Unspecified" values might appear in the middle of results, making it harder to focus on actual data.

      Use case resumes at step 1.

* 1b. FA does not want to include a description.

    * 1b1. ClientCore accepts the package and leave the description blank.

      Use case ends.

**Use case: U8. Deleting an insurance package**

**Precondition:**

1. FA is logged into the app.
2. The package list contains 1 or more package.

**MSS**

1. FA requests to list packages.
2. ClientCore shows the list of packages.
3. FA requests to delete one of the packages.
4. ClientCore deletes the package and removes it from the list of packages.

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 3a. FA tries to delete a default package.

    * 3a1. ClientCore cancels the action and state that default packages cannot be deleted.

      Use case resumes at step 2.

* 3b. The given name does not match with any packages.

    * 3b1. ClientCore shows an error message.
  
      Use case resumes at step 2.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Platform Compatibility
1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.

#### Performance and Responsiveness 
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.

#### Scalability 
4. The system should be designed to scale to larger datasets (e.g., â‰¥10,000 contacts) with minimal architectural changes.

#### Usability 
5. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) 
should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
6. Commands should be concise, memorable, and consistent.
7. Error messages should be clear, instructive, and suggest corrective action.

#### Reliability and Fault Tolerance 
8. The application should not crash in the event of invalid inputs. 
9. Must handle unexpected shutdowns gracefully without loss of stored data. 

#### Security and Privacy 
10. All sensitive data (salary, occupation, contact details, etc) must be stored securely.
11. Must comply with existing data privacy regulations. 

#### Maintainability 
12. Code must be modular and follow standard Java conventions.
13. Build should be automated via Gradle. 
14. Unit and integration tests should provide ample coverage of the codebase. 

#### Extensibility 
15. The system should support the addition of new commands with minimal changes to existing code.

#### Portability 
16. The application should be distributable as a single JAR file and run consistently across
supported platforms without requiring external dependencies. 

#### Documentation 
17. User guide should explain all commands clearly with examples.
18. Developer Guide should include instructions for setting up the development environment.
19. Public classes and methods in the codebase should include Javadoc header comments that describe its purpose, 
parameters, return values, and any exceptions thrown. These comments should follow the official JavaDoc conventions.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based interface where the user types commands instead of 
graphical elements.
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others.
* **Financial Advisor (FA)**: A professional user of the system whose job is to manage client 
relationships and recommend suitable financial products or services.
* **Client**: An individual whose personal and financial details (e.g., age, salary, policies, risk profile) 
are stored in the system. Clients are the primary focus of the Financial Advisorâ€™s work and the main type of
contact being managed. 
* **Client Profile**: A structured record containing personal and financial information of a client (e.g. name,
age, salary, relationship status). 
* **Tag**: A label applied to a client profile to group clients meaningfully.
* **Command**: A typed instruction given to the system to perform an action (e.g. list, add, find, delete).
* **Archiving**: The act of marking a client profile as inactive (not deleted) for long-term storage,
    so that it no longer shows up in day-to-day operations but can be retrieved if needed.
* **Offline**: The ability to use the system without an internet connection.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.
